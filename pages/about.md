My name is Tran Le, a PhD student from Department of Data Science from [UMMC](https://www.umc.edu/SoPH/Departments-and-Faculty/Data-Science/Department-of-Data-Science-Home.html).

I got my Master from [Department of Mathematics, Syracuse University](https://thecollege.syr.edu/mathematics/)

Through working with a final project using Convolution Neural Network in a binary classification problem ([link to the problem in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)). I got my tesing accuracy is arround 90%. Then I found out that one person git 100% acuuracy using Fastai. It motivated me to start learning Fastai.
